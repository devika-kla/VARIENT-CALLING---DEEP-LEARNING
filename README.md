# VARIENT-CALLING---DEEP-LEARNING
This mini project presents a novel and simple approach that harnesses the power of deep learning to improve variant calling from sequencing data. The goal of our project is to identify and predict diseases using the strurtural variations in the genome sequence reads. Structural variations refer to genomic variations, such as deletion, insertion, single nucleotide variation, and inversion. We use a simple Convolutional Neural Network to train our model. The images we created from the matrix are used as the inputs for the model, and it is used for training. We design the network output to call a candidate a “heterozygous variant”, “homozygous variant”, “non-variant”, or “complex-variant”. Besides classifying the variant type of the candidate sites, the network is also trained to predict the possible variant bases with minimal tuning.
